## Features

- **Full API coverage** — All 17 LemonSqueezy API resources with 61 tools
- **JSON:API support** — Filtering, pagination, and relationship inclusion on all list/get operations
- **Zero runtime dependencies** — Single bundled file for instant `npx` startup
- **License API** — Activate, validate, and deactivate license keys without an API key
- **MCP annotations** — Every tool declares read-only, destructive, and idempotent hints
- **Retry with backoff** — 429 and 5xx retries (idempotent methods only) with exponential backoff and jitter
- **Guardrails** — optional store allowlist, refund cap, and destructive-call rate limit
- **Structured logging** — opt-in JSON logs to stderr for observability and audit

## Configuration

All configuration is via environment variables. Only `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` (or `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY_COMMAND`) is required; everything else is opt-in.

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY` | LemonSqueezy API token. |
| `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY_COMMAND` | Command whose stdout produces the API key. Overrides `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY`. Output is cached for 1 hour. Use this to pull short-lived credentials from a vault (`op read`, `gcloud secrets versions access`, etc.) without writing them to env vars. |
| `LEMONSQUEEZY_ALLOWED_STORE_IDS` | Comma-separated allowlist of store IDs. When set, tools that receive a `storeId` input reject calls to any other store. Note: operations that don't take an explicit `storeId` (e.g. `ls_refund_order`) are not gated by this — pair with `LEMONSQUEEZY_MAX_REFUND_AMOUNT_CENTS`. |
| `LEMONSQUEEZY_MAX_REFUND_AMOUNT_CENTS` | Rejects `ls_refund_order` and `ls_refund_subscription_invoice` calls above this amount. |
| `LEMONSQUEEZY_DESTRUCTIVE_RATE_LIMIT` | Max destructive tool calls per 60-second rolling window. In-process limit — per MCP server instance, not global. |
| `LEMONSQUEEZY_LOG=json` | Emit one JSON log line to stderr per tool and HTTP call. Destructive calls are tagged `audit: true` and include their inputs. |

### Logging format

Each line: `{ts, event, tool?, method?, path?, status, latency_ms, request_id?, error?, audit?, inputs?}`. Stdout is reserved for the MCP protocol — never log there.

### Error decoration

HTTP errors include the upstream `X-Request-Id` when present, so support tickets to LemonSqueezy can reference the exact call.

## Operating the server unattended

For unattended/agentic use against a live store, we recommend:

1. Set `LEMONSQUEEZY_ALLOWED_STORE_IDS` to the specific store(s) the agent may touch.
2. Set `LEMONSQUEEZY_MAX_REFUND_AMOUNT_CENTS` to a per-call cap well below any single-refund expectation.
3. Set `LEMONSQUEEZY_DESTRUCTIVE_RATE_LIMIT` to a small number (e.g. 5/min) as a runaway-agent circuit breaker.
4. Set `LEMONSQUEEZY_LOG=json` and ship stderr to your log aggregator. Alert on `status: "guardrail_block"` or elevated error rates per tool.
5. Run `LEMONSQUEEZY_API_KEY_COMMAND` against a vault-backed secret so credentials can rotate without restarting the server process.

What the server does **not** do and you must own at the caller level:

- **Idempotency / dedupe store** — MCP servers are stateless subprocesses; cross-invocation dedupe belongs in your agent or orchestrator.
- **Webhook reconciliation** — subscribe to LemonSqueezy webhooks in a separate long-running process to reconcile state when API writes succeed but the response is lost. See [@yawlabs/lemonsqueezy-webhook-sink](https://github.com/YawLabs/lemonsqueezy-webhook-sink) for a ready-made sink.
- **Metrics / dashboards** — the server emits structured logs; derive metrics in your log pipeline.

See [SEMVER.md](./SEMVER.md) for the versioning policy.
