# Release script -- local + CI dual mode: lint, test, build, tag, publish, release
# =============================================================================
# Usage:
#   ./release.sh <version>      e.g. ./release.sh 0.7.0    -- local end-to-end
#   ./release.sh                -- CI mode (derives version from $GITHUB_REF_NAME)
#
# If interrupted, re-run with the same version. Each step is idempotent:
# already-bumped, already-tagged, already-published, and already-released
# states are detected and skipped.
#
# Prerequisites for LOCAL runs (one-time setup on this machine):
#   - Node.js 20+
#   - npm authenticated as a publisher of @yawlabs/lemonsqueezy-mcp via an
#     AUTOMATION token in ~/.npmrc (npmjs.com -> Access Tokens -> Generate
#     -> Automation):
#       @yawlabs:registry=https://registry.npmjs.org/
#       //registry.npmjs.org/:_authToken=npm_YOURTOKEN
#     Do NOT run 'npm login --auth-type=web' -- it OVERWRITES that automation
#     token with a 2FA-bound web session, and the next publish then EOTPs on
#     a WebAuthn challenge (any CI sharing the token starts failing too).
#   - GitHub CLI authenticated
#       gh auth login
#
# Prerequisites for CI runs:
#   - $CI=true
#   - $GITHUB_REF_NAME=vX.Y.Z (set automatically by the tag-push trigger)
#   - $NODE_AUTH_TOKEN populated from secrets.NPM_TOKEN (org-level)
#   - $GITHUB_TOKEN populated automatically by Actions
#
# Either path produces an identical artifact; the typical workflow is to bump
# + commit + tag + push locally and let CI handle steps 5-6 via the tag-push
# trigger in .github/workflows/release.yml.
